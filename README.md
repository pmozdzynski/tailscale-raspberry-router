# üõ† Tailscale Raspberry Router

**Tailscale Raspberry Router** is a project that turns a Raspberry Pi or any Linux device into a **Tailscale-powered VPN Router**. It enables devices on a local network to route their traffic through **Tailscale exit nodes**, including **Mullvad VPN nodes** and **Private Exit Nodes**.

This project allows:
- **Seamless integration with Tailscale**
- **Easy switching between direct internet & Tailscale exit nodes**
- **Running on Raspberry Pi & Linux Desktops**
- **Multi-interface support (e.g., `eth0`, `wlan0`, `wlan1`)**
- **Web Dashboard for controlling exit nodes** üåç
- **Support for Private Exit Nodes for self-hosted VPN routing**
- **Recommends `dnsmasq` for DHCP on a second interface if needed**
- **Creates a VPN router for secure traffic routing over Tailscale**
- **Useful for securing devices that require a stable VPN connection**

## **üöÄ Features**
‚úÖ **Use a Raspberry Pi or any Linux device as a Tailscale-powered VPN router**  
‚úÖ **Dynamic detection of available exit nodes (including Mullvad VPN & Private Exit Nodes)**  
‚úÖ **Real-time web dashboard to switch between exit nodes**  
‚úÖ **Persistent mode saving (restores the last used exit node on startup)**  
‚úÖ **Auto-detects and configures the primary network interface (e.g., `eth0`, `wlan0`)**  
‚úÖ **Runs as a systemd service for automatic startup**  
‚úÖ **Supports two network interfaces (one for WAN, one for LAN clients) but works with just one**  
‚úÖ **Allows external DHCP configuration (e.g., `dnsmasq` for local clients)**  
‚úÖ **Supports `friendly-names.json` to assign friendly names to exit nodes**  
‚úÖ **Acts as a VPN router for devices needing secure and consistent VPN connections**

## **üíª Installation & Setup**

### **1Ô∏è‚É£ Install & Authenticate Tailscale**
```sh
curl -fsSL https://tailscale.com/install.sh | sh
```
Then, authenticate your device:
```sh
sudo tailscale up
```

### **2Ô∏è‚É£ Clone the Repository & Compile for Your Platform**
```sh
git clone https://github.com/pmozdzynski/tailscale-raspberry-router.git
cd tailscale-raspberry-router
```
#### **Cross-Platform Build for Raspberry Pi and Linux Devices**
To build for different architectures, use the appropriate `GOARCH` and `GOARM` flags:
```sh
# For Raspberry Pi 4 (ARM64)
GOOS=linux GOARCH=arm64 go build -o tailscale-raspberry-router main.go

# For Raspberry Pi 3/2/1 (32-bit ARM)
GOOS=linux GOARCH=arm GOARM=7 go build -o tailscale-raspberry-router main.go

# For x86_64 Linux Desktops
GOOS=linux GOARCH=amd64 go build -o tailscale-raspberry-router main.go
```
Move the compiled binary:
```sh
sudo mkdir -p /opt/tailscale-raspberry-router/templates/
sudo mv tailscale-raspberry-router /opt/tailscale-raspberry-router/
sudo mv templates/* /opt/tailscale-raspberry-router/templates/
```

### **3Ô∏è‚É£ Set Up the Systemd Service**
```sh
sudo nano /etc/systemd/system/tailscale-router.service
```
Paste the following:
```
[Unit]
Description=VPN Router Service
After=network-online.target tailscaled.service systemd-networkd-wait-online.service
Wants=network-online.target tailscaled.service systemd-networkd-wait-online.service
Before=shutdown.target

[Service]
Type=idle
ExecStartPre=/bin/sh -c 'echo "Starting Tailscale Router service, please wait..." | systemd-cat -t tailscale-router'; /bin/sleep 15
ExecStart=/opt/tailscale-raspberry-router/tailscale-raspberry-router
WorkingDirectory=/opt/tailscale-raspberry-router/
Restart=always
RestartSec=5
User=root

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
```
Enable and start:
```sh
sudo systemctl daemon-reload
sudo systemctl enable tailscale-router.service
sudo systemctl start tailscale-router.service
```
> **Note:** The service takes approximately **15-30 seconds** to start due to the sleep delay and tailscale/interfaces detection. Please wait before attempting to access the Web UI.

Then, access the Web UI at: 
```
http://<your-device-ip>:5000
```
Use this interface to log in and select an **exit node**.

Please note: You must have at least 1 active Exit node on your account to see anything it in router web-UI. You can check them here https://login.tailscale.com/admin/machines  
If you do not have any own Exit nodes, you can get paid Mullvad addon from https://login.tailscale.com/admin/settings/general

## **üîí Using an Exit Node for LAN Clients**

This device cannot act as an exit node but can route all connected LAN clients through a Tailscale Exit Node. It functions as a router for LAN clients, forwarding their traffic through an external Tailscale Exit Node rather than terminating VPN connections itself.

### **Selecting an Exit Node via Web Interface**

1Ô∏è‚É£ Open the Web Dashboard:
```
http://<your-device-ip>:5000
```
2Ô∏è‚É£ Choose an available **exit node** from the list.


3Ô∏è‚É£ Click **Apply** to route all LAN traffic through the selected exit node.

### **Verify Connection**
To ensure that LAN clients are routing traffic through the selected exit node, run the following command on any connected client:
```sh
curl ifconfig.me
```
The output should match the external IP of the selected exit node.

## **üêù Cross-Platform Compatibility**
This project supports multiple architectures, including:
- **Raspberry Pi 4 (ARM64)**
- **Raspberry Pi 3/2/1 (ARM32 with GOARM=7)**
- **x86_64 Linux Desktops**
- **Other Linux-based single-board computers**

Ensure you compile the binary for the correct architecture before deployment.
